## The Concept
Blow up a balloon and use air pressure from a leaf blower to guide it through a generative scrolling path
The more helium you put in the balloon, the more points you get but the faster it rises and the harder it is

## Ideas
Rather than an infinite scroll up or down, why not make it kind of 3D? Stretch goal
